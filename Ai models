### 1. **Tax Estimation Model**:
   - **Input**: User details (income, deductions, exemptions, etc.).
   - **Output**: Estimated tax liability.
   - **Model**: We can use machine learning techniques or rule-based logic to calculate tax estimates based on India's tax slabs, deductions, and exemptions.

### 2. **Expense Categorization Model**:
   - **Input**: Transaction details (amount, date, merchant).
   - **Output**: Categorized expenses (e.g., groceries, entertainment, transportation).
   - **Model**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques or supervised learning models like **SVM** or **Random Forest** can be trained to classify transactions into categories.

### 3. **Budget Forecasting Model**:
   - **Input**: Historical expense data from the user.
   - **Output**: Future expense predictions and budgeting advice.
   - **Model**: We can use time series forecasting models like **ARIMA** or machine learning models like **XGBoost** to predict future expenses based on past data.

### 4. **Financial Health Scoring Model**:
   - **Input**: User financial data (income, expenses, savings, investments).
   - **Output**: A score indicating financial health (e.g., good, average, needs improvement).
   - **Model**: A classification model using algorithms like **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest** could provide a financial health score based on key factors.

### 5. **Personalized Savings Recommendations**:
   - **Input**: User spending habits, income, savings goals.
   - **Output**: Recommendations on how much the user should save each month to meet their goals.
   - **Model**: **Collaborative filtering** or **KNN** (k-nearest neighbors) could be used to recommend personalized savings tips.

### 6. **Investment Recommendation System**:
   - **Input**: User risk profile, financial goals, investment history.
   - **Output**: Suggested investment options (stocks, mutual funds, etc.).
   - **Model**: A recommender system using **content-based filtering** or **matrix factorization** could recommend investments based on user preferences.

### Tools & Libraries for AI Models:
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models like classification, regression, and clustering.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For deep learning models (e.g., neural networks).
- **NLP libraries**: For text-based categorization (like **spaCy**, **NLTK**).
- **Pandas / NumPy**: For data processing and manipulation.

### Next Steps:
1. We can create a simple **Flask API** to handle AI model requests.
2. **Train models** using sample datasets and integrate them with the backend.
3. **Connect the models** to the frontend to show predictions or recommendations to the user.
